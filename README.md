# Candyland

This project is a website used for studying for a test. The site is inpired by the real life strategy of writing a question on a card and the answer on the back and doing so for all things you want to learn. You only have one question in front of you at a time to help you focus.

This website has been made using C#.NET, MVC, Entity Framework and Bootstrap.
